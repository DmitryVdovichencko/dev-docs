# Полное руководство по авторизации с помощью Passport JS

<Picture url='passport-guide/passport-js-course.png' />

В этой статье, я собираюсь объяснить как работает стратегия авторизации Passport-JWT - простое, безопасное и оптималоьное решение для небольших проектов, работающих на связке Node/Express + фронтенд на любом из популярных JS фреймворков/библиотек (Angular, Vue, React).

Чтобы понять, почему механизм авторизации JWT - лучший выбор в данном случае, мы пробежимся по доступным механизмам авторизации, разберемся как они работают, и как их реализовать в приложении (за исключением протокола OAuth, который здесь рассматриваться не будет).

Поскольку, пост получился довольно обширным и детальным, если вы уже знакомы с какой-либо темой, смело пропускайте ее. Аналогично, если вы просто ищете инструкции как релизовать механизм авторизации, можете перейти к следующим секциям:

- [Авторизация с помощью сессий]()
- [Авторизация с помощью JWT]()

Также, я подготовил примеры приложений с реализациями этих способов авторизации. Посмотреть на примеры можно по ссылкам на репозитории:

- [Session Based Auth Repo](https://github.com/zachgoll/express-session-authentication-starter)
- [JWT Auth Repo](https://github.com/zachgoll/express-jwt-authentication-starter)

## Выбор механизма авторизации

<Picture url='passport-guide/auth-types.png' />

Выше представлены основные варианты механизмов авторизации доступные разработчикам. Вот краткое описания каждого из них:

- __Session - Авторизация на основе сессии__ - Использует Cookies браузера совместно с сессиями ("Sessions") на бэкенде для управления login/logout пользователей.

- __JWT Авторизация__ - Метод авторизации без состояния, где JSON Web token (JWT) записывается в браузере (обычно в localStorage). В JWT хранятся данные пользователя и они могут быть расшифрованы только с помощью секретного ключа, который хранится на сервере.

- __OAuth и OpenID Connect Авторизация__ - Современный метод авторизации где приложения используют "подписи", сгенерированные другими приложениями для авторизации своих пользователей. Другими словами, это интегрированная авторизация где популярный сервис (например Google) реализует авторизацию и хранение данных пользователей, тогда как ваше приложение всего лишь его использует.
Замечу, что Oauth довольно сложный механизм, и, поэтому, в этой статье мы его подробно не рассматриваем. Не только, потому что он излишен для небольших команд/стартапов запускающих приложение, но также, из-за того что он сильно зависит от используемого сервиса (таких как Google, Facebook, Github, и т.д.).

Ну и наконец, вы наверное заметили,что OAuth указан как "As a service" и "In house". Это сделано специально,чтобы отметить тот факт, что вообще-то есть компания называющаяся "OAuth", которая реализует OAuth протокол... как сервис - As a service. Но вы можете реализовать OAuth протокол без использования услуг компании "OAuth"!

## Что такое авторизация на основе сессии (Session Based Authentication)?

Если бы мы делали родословную методов авторизации, авторизация на основе сессиибыла бы самой старшей, но, определенно не устаревшей. Этот метод авторизации "server-side", что означает, что наше Express приложение и база данных работают вместе, чтобы сохранить текущий статус авторизации каждого пользователя, посещающего наше приложение.

Чтобы понять основные принципы работы авторизации на основе сессии, необходимо разобраться в следующих темах:

- Основы заголовков протокола HTTP
- Что такое cookie
- Что такое сессия (session)
- Как сессия session (на сервере) и cookie (в браузере) взаимодействуюи при авторизации пользователя

### HTTP Headers
There are many ways to make an HTTP request in a browser. An HTTP client could be a web application, IoT device, command line (curl), or a multitude of others. Each of these clients connect to the internet and make HTTP requests which either fetch data (GET), or modify data (POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).

For explanation purposes, let's assume that:

Server = www.google.com Client = random guy in a coffee shop working on a laptop

When that random person from the coffee shop types www.google.com into their Google Chrome browser, this request will be sent with "HTTP Headers". These HTTP Headers are key:value pairs that provide additional data to the browser to help complete the request. This request will have two types of headers:

General Headers
Request Headers
To make this interactive, open Google Chrome, open your developer tools (right click, "Inspect"), and click on the "Network" tab. Now, type www.google.com into your address bar, and watch as the Network tab loads several resources from the server. You should see several columns like Name, Status, Type, Initiator, Size, Time, and Waterfall. Find the request that has "document" as the "Type" value and click on it. You should see all the headers for this request and response interaction.

The request that you (as the client) made will have General and Request headers resembling (but not exact) the following:

General Headers
  Request URL: https://www.google.com/
  Request Method: GET
  Status Code: 200
Request Headers
  Accept: text/html
  Accept-Language: en-US
  Connection: keep-alive
When you typed www.google.com into your address bar and pressed enter, your HTTP request was sent with these headers (and probably a few others). Although these headers are relatively self explanatory, I want to walk through a few to get a better idea of what HTTP Headers are used for. Feel free to look up any you don't know on MDN.

The General headers can be a mix of both request and response data. Clearly, the Request URL and Request Method are part of the request object and they tell the Google Chrome browser where to route your request. The Status Code is clearly part of the response because it indicates that your GET request was successfull and the webpage at www.google.com loaded okay.

The Request Headers only contain headers included with the request object itself. You can think of request headers as "instructions for the server". In this case, my request tells the Google server the following:

Hey Google Server, please send me HTML or text data. I'm either incapable or not interested in reading anything else right now!
Hey Google Server, please only send me English words
Hey Google Server, please don't close my connection with you after the request is over
There are many more request headers that you can set, but these are just a few common ones that you will probably see on all HTTP requests.

So when you searched for www.google.com, you sent your request and the headers to the Google Server (for simplicity, we will just assume it is one big server). The Google Server accepted your request, read through the "instructions" (headers), and created a response. The response was comprised of:

HTML data (what you see in your Browser)
HTTP Headers
As you might have guessed, the "Response Headers" were those set by the Google Server. Here are a few that you might see:

Response Headers
  Content-Length: 41485
  Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
  Set-Cookie: made_up_cookie_name=some value; expires=Thu, 28-Dec-2020 20:44:50 GMT;
These response headers are fairly straightforward with the exception of the Set-Cookie header.

I included the Set-Cookie header because it is exactly what we need to understand in order to learn what Session based Authentication is all about (and will help us understand other auth methods later in this post).

How Cookies Work
Without Cookies in the browser, we have a problem.

If we have a protected webpage that we want our users to login to access, without cookies, those users would have to login every time they refresh the page! That is because the HTTP protocol is by default "stateless".

Cookies introduce the concept of "persistent state" and allow the browser to "remember" something that the server told it previously.

The Google Server can tell my Google Chrome Browser to give me access to a protected page, but the second I refresh the page, my browser will "forget" this and make me authenticate again.

This is where Cookies come in, and explains what the Set-Cookie header is aiming to do. In the above request where we typed in www.google.com into our browser and pressed enter, our client sent a request with some headers, and the Google Server responsed with a response and some headers. One of these response headers was Set-Cookie: made_up_cookie_name=some value; expires=Thu, 28-Dec-2020 20:44:50 GMT;. Here's how this interaction works:

Server: "Hey client! I want you to set a cookie called made_up_cookie_name and set it equal to some value.

Client: "Hey server, I will set this on the Cookie header of all my requests to this domain until Dec 28, 2020!"

We can verify that this actually happened in Google Chrome Developer Tools. Go to "Application"->"Storage" and click "Cookies". Now click on the site that you are currently visiting and you will see all the cookies that have been set for this site. In our made-up example, you might see something like:

Name	Value	Expires / Max-Age
madeupcookie_name	some value	2020-12-28T20:44:50.674Z
This cookie will now be set to the Cookie Request Header on all requests made to www.google.com until the expiry date set on the cookie.

As you might conclude, this could be extremely useful for authentication if we set some sort of "auth" cookie. An overly simplified process of how this might work would be:

Random person from the coffee shop types www.example-site.com/login/ into the browser
Random person from the coffee shop fills out a form on this page with a username and password
Random person's Google Chrome Browser submits a POST request with the login data (username, password) to the server running www.example-site.com.
The server running www.example-site.com receives the login info, checks the database for that login info, validates the login info, and if successful, creates a response that has the header Set-Cookie: user_is_authenticated=true; expires=Thu, 1-Jan-2020 20:00:00 GMT.
The random person's Google Chrome browser receives this response and sets a browser cookie:
Name	Value	Expires / Max-Age
userisauthenticated	true	2020-12-28T20:44:50.674Z
The random person now visits www.example-site.com/protected-route/
The random person's browser creates an HTTP request with the header Cookie: user_is_authenticated=true; expires=Thu, 1-Jan-2020 20:00:00 GMT attached to the request.
The server receives this request, sees that there is a cookie on the request, "remembers" that it had authenticated this user just a few seconds ago, and allows the user to visit the page.
The Reality of this Situation
Obviously, what I have just described would be a highly insecure way to authenticate a user. In reality, the server would create some sort of hash from the password the user provided, and validate that hash with some crypto library on the server.

That said, the high-level concept is valid, and it allows us to understand the value of cookies when talking about authentication.

Keep this example in mind as we move through the remainder of this post.

Sessions
Sessions and cookies are actually quite similar, and can get confused because they can actually be used together quite seamlessly. The main difference between the two is the location of their storage.

In other words, a Cookie is set by the server, but stored in the Browser. If the server wants to use this Cookie to store data about a user's "state", it would have to come up with an elaborate scheme to constantly keep track of what the cookie in the browser looks like. It might go something like this:

Server: Hey browser, I just authenticated this user, so you should store a cookie to remind me (Set-Cookie: user_auth=true; expires=Thu, 1-Jan-2020 20:00:00 GMT) next time you request something from me
Browser: Thanks, server! I will attach this cookie to my Cookie request header
Browser: Hey server, can I see the contents at www.domain.com/protected? Here is the cookie you sent me on the last request.
Server: Sure, I can do that. Here is the page data. I have also included another Set-Cookie header (Set-Cookie: marketing_page_visit_count=1; user_ip=192.1.234.21) because the company who owns me likes to track how many people have visited this specific page and from which computer for marketing purposes.
Browser: Okay, I'll add that cookie to my Cookie request header
Browser: Hey Server, can you send me the contents at www.domain.com/protected/special-offer? Here are all the cookies that you have set on me so far. (Cookie: user_auth=true; expires=Thu, 1-Jan-2020 20:00:00 GMT; marketing_page_visit_count=1; user_ip=192.1.234.21)
As you can see, the more pages the browser visits, the more cookies the Server sets, and the more cookies the Browser must attach in each request Header.

The Server might have some function that parses through all the cookies attached to a request and perform certain actions based on the presence or absence of a specific cookie. To me, this naturally begs the question... Why doesn't the server just keep a record of this information in a database and use a single "session ID" to identify events that a user is taking?

This is exactly what a session is for. As I mentioned, the main difference between a cookie and a session is where they are stored. A session is stored in some Data Store (fancy term for a database) while a Cookie is stored in the Browser. Since the session is stored on the server, it can store sensitive information. Storing sensitive information in a cookie would be highly insecure.

Now where this all gets a bit confusing is when we talk about using cookies and session together.

Since Cookies are the method in which the client and server communicate metadata (among other HTTP Headers), a session must still utilize cookies. The easiest way to see this interaction is by actually building out a simple authentication application in Node + Express + MongoDB. I will assume that you have a basic understanding of building apps in Express, but I will try to explain each piece as we go.

Setup a basic app:

mkdir session-auth-app
cd session-auth-app
npm init -y
npm install --save express mongoose dotenv connect-mongo express-session passport passport-local
Here is app.js. Read through the comments to learn more about what is going on before continuing.
```javascript
const express = require("express");
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const session = require("express-session");
// Package documentation - https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-mongo
const MongoStore = require("connect-mongo")(session);
/**
 * -------------- GENERAL SETUP ----------------
 */
// Gives us access to variables set in the .env file via `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME` syntax
require("dotenv").config();
// Create the Express application
var app = express();
// Middleware that allows Express to parse through both JSON and x-www-form-urlencoded request bodies
// These are the same as `bodyParser` - you probably would see bodyParser put here in most apps
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
/**
 * -------------- DATABASE ----------------
 */
/**
 * Connect to MongoDB Server using the connection string in the `.env` file.  To implement this, place the following
 * string into the `.env` file
 *
 * DB_STRING=mongodb://<user>:<password>@localhost:27017/database_name
 */
const connection = mongoose.createConnection(process.env.DB_STRING);
// Creates simple schema for a User.  The hash and salt are derived from the user's given password when they register
const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: String,
  hash: String,
  salt: String,
});
// Defines the model that we will use in the app
mongoose.model("User", UserSchema);
/**
 * -------------- SESSION SETUP ----------------
 */
/**
 * The MongoStore is used to store session data.  We will learn more about this in the post.
 *
 * Note that the `connection` used for the MongoStore is the same connection that we are using above
 */
const sessionStore = new MongoStore({
  mongooseConnection: connection,
  collection: "sessions",
});
/**
 * See the documentation for all possible options - https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session
 *
 * As a brief overview (we will add more later):
 *
 * secret: This is a random string that will be used to "authenticate" the session.  In a production environment,
 * you would want to set this to a long, randomly generated string
 *
 * resave: when set to true, this will force the session to save even if nothing changed.  If you don't set this,
 * the app will still run but you will get a warning in the terminal
 *
 * saveUninitialized: Similar to resave, when set true, this forces the session to be saved even if it is unitialized
 */
app.use(
  session({
    secret: process.env.SECRET,
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: true,
    store: sessionStore,
  })
);
/**
 * -------------- ROUTES ----------------
 */
// When you visit http://localhost:3000/login, you will see "Login Page"
app.get("/login", (req, res, next) => {
  res.send("<h1>Login Page</h1>");
});
app.post("/login", (req, res, next) => {});
// When you visit http://localhost:3000/register, you will see "Register Page"
app.get("/register", (req, res, next) => {
  res.send("<h1>Register Page</h1>");
});
app.post("/register", (req, res, next) => {});
/**
 * -------------- SERVER ----------------
 */
// Server listens on http://localhost:3000
app.listen(3000);
The first thing we need to do is understand how the express-session module is working within this application. This is a "middleware", which is a fancy way of saying that it is a function that modifies something in our application.

Quick Refresher on Express Middleware
Let's say we had the following code:

const express = require("express");
var app = express();
// Custom middleware
function myMiddleware1(req, res, next) {
  req.newProperty = "my custom property";
  next();
}
// Another custom middleware
function myMiddleware2(req, res, next) {
  req.newProperty = "updated value";
  next();
}
app.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  res.send(`<h1>Custom Property Value: ${req.newProperty}`);
});
// Server listens on http://localhost:3000
app.listen(3000);
```
As you can see, this is an extremely simple Express application that defines two middlewares and has a single route that you can visit in your browser at http://localhost:3000. If you started this application and visited that route, it would say "Custom Property Value: undefined" because defining middleware functions alone is not enough.

We need to tell the Express application to actually use these middlewares. We can do this in a few ways. First, we can do it within a route.
```javascript
app.get("/", myMiddleware1, (req, res, next) => {
  res.send(`<h1>Custom Property Value: ${req.newProperty}`);
});
```
If you add the first middleware function as an argument to the route, you will now see "Custom Property Value: my custom property" show up in the browser. What really happened here:

The application was initialized
A user visited http://localhost:3000/ in the browser, which triggered the app.get() function.
The Express application first checked to see if there was any "global" middleware installed on the router, but it didn't find any.
The Express application looked at the app.get() function and noticed that there was a middleware function installed before the callback. The application ran the middleware and passed the middleware the req object, res object, and the next() callback.
The myMiddleware1 middleware first set req.newProperty, and then called next(), which tells the Express application "Go to the next middleware". If the middleware did not call next(), the browser would get "stuck" and not return anything.
The Express app did not see any more middleware, so it continued with the request and sent the result.
This is just one way to use middleware, and it is exactly how the passport.authenticate() function (more on this later, so keep in mind) works.

Another way we can use middleware is by setting it "globally". Take a look at our app after this change:
```javascript
const express = require("express");
var app = express();
// Custom middleware
function myMiddleware1(req, res, next) {
  req.newProperty = "my custom property";
  next();
}
// Another custom middleware
function myMiddleware2(req, res, next) {
  req.newProperty = "updated value";
  next();
}
app.use(myMiddleware2);
app.get("/", myMiddleware1, (req, res, next) => {
  // Sends "Custom Property Value: my custom property
  res.send(`<h1>Custom Property Value: ${req.newProperty}`);
});
// Server listens on http://localhost:3000
app.listen(3000);
With this app structure, you will notice that visiting http://localhost:3000/ in the browser still returns the same value as before. This is because the app.use(myMiddleware2) middleware is happening before the app.get('/', myMiddleware1). If we removed the middleware from the route, you will see the updated value in the browser.

app.use(myMiddleware2);
app.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  // Sends "Custom Property Value: updated value
  res.send(`<h1>Custom Property Value: ${req.newProperty}`);
});
We could also get this result by placing the second middleware after the first within the route.

app.get("/", myMiddleware1, myMiddleware2, (req, res, next) => {
  // Sends "Custom Property Value: updated value
  res.send(`<h1>Custom Property Value: ${req.newProperty}`);
});
```

Although this is a quick and high-level overview of middleware in Express, it will help us understand what is going on with the express-session middleware.

How Express Session Middleware works
As I mentioned before, the express-session module gives us middleware that we can use in our application. The middleware is defined in this line:
```javascript
// Again, here is the documentation for this - https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session
app.use(
  session({
    secret: process.env.SECRET,
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: true,
    store: sessionStore,
  })
);
```

Here is a brief overview of what the Express Session Middleware is doing:

When a route is loaded, the middleware checks to see if there is a session established in the Session Store (MongoDB database in our case since we are using the connect-mongo custom Session Store).
If there is a session, the middleware validates it cryptographically and then tells the Browser whether the session is valid or not. If it is valid, the Browser automatically attaches the connect.sid Cookie to the HTTP request.
If there is no session, the middleware creates a new session, takes a cryptographic hash of the session, and stores that value in a Cookie called connect.sid. It then attaches the Set-Cookie HTTP header to the res object with the hashed value (Set-Cookie: connect.sid=hashed value).
You might be wondering why this is useful at all, and how all this actually works.

If you remember from the quick refresher on Express Middlewares, I said that a middleware has the ability to alter the req and res objects that are passed from one middleware to the next until it reaches the end of the HTTP request. Just like we set a custom property on the req object, we could also set something much more complex like a session object that has properties, methods, etc.

That is exactly what the express-session middleware does. When a new session is created, the following properties are added to the req object:

req.sessionID - A randomly generated UUID. You can define a custom function to generate this ID by setting the genid option. If you do not set this option, the default is to use the uid-safe module.

```javascript
app.use(
  session({
    genid: function (req) {
      // Put your UUID implementation here
    },
  })
);
req.session - The Session object. This contains information about the session and is available for setting custom properties to use. For example, maybe you want to track how many times a particular page is loaded in a single session:
app.get("/tracking-route", (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.session.viewCount) {
    req.session.viewCount = req.session.viewCount + 1;
  } else {
    req.session.viewCount = 1;
  }
  res.send("<p>View count is: " + req.session.viewCount + "</p>");
});
```

req.session.cookie - The Cookie object. This defines the behaviour of the cookie that stores the hashed session ID in the browser. Remember, once the cookie has been set, the browser will attach it to every HTTP request automatically until it expires.
How Passport JS Local Strategy works
There is one last thing that we need to learn in order to fully understand Session Based Authentication--Passport JS.

Passport JS has over 500 authentication "Strategies" that can be used within a Node/Express app. Many of these strategies are highly specific (i.e. passport-amazon allows you to authenticate into your app via Amazon credentials), but they all work similar within your Express app.

In my opinion, the Passport module could use some work in the department of documentation. Not only does Passport consist of two modules (Passport base + Specific Strategy), but it is also a middleware, which as we saw is a bit confusing in its own right. To add to the confusion, the strategy that we are going to walk through (passport-local) is a middleware that modifies an object created by another middleware (express-session). Since the Passport documentation has little to say around how this all works, I will attempt to explain it to the best of my ability in this post.

Let's first walk through the setup of the module.

If you have been following along with this tutorial, you already have the modules needed. If not, you will need to install Passport and a Strategy to your project.
```bash
npm install --save passport passport-local
```
Once you have done that, you will need to implement Passport within your application. Below, I have added all the pieces you need for the passport-local strategy. I have removed comments to simplify. Take a quick read through the code and then we will walk through all of the // NEW code.
```javascript
const express = require("express");
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const session = require("express-session");
// NEW
const passport = require("passport");
const LocalStrategy = require("passport-local").Strategy;
var crypto = require("crypto");

        // Function defined at bottom of app.js
        const isValid = validPassword(password, user.hash, user.salt);
        if (isValid) {
          return cb(null, user);
        } else {

```
Yes, I know there is a lot to take in here. Let's start with the easy parts--the helper functions. In the code above, I have two helper functions that will assist in creating and validating a password.
```javascript
/**
 *
 * @param {*} password - The plain text password
 * @param {*} hash - The hash stored in the database
 * @param {*} salt - The salt stored in the database
 *
 * This function uses the crypto library to decrypt the hash using the salt and then compares
 * the decrypted hash/salt with the password that the user provided at login
 */
function validPassword(password, hash, salt) {
  var hashVerify = crypto
    .pbkdf2Sync(password, salt, 10000, 64, "sha512")
    .toString("hex");
  return hash === hashVerify;
}
/**
 *
 * @param {*} password - The password string that the user inputs to the password field in the register form
 *
 * This function takes a plain text password and creates a salt and hash out of it.  Instead of storing the plaintext
 * password in the database, the salt and hash are stored for security
 *
 * ALTERNATIVE: It would also be acceptable to just use a hashing algorithm to make a hash of the plain text password.
 * You would then store the hashed password in the database and then re-hash it to verify later (similar to what we do here)
 */
function genPassword(password) {
  var salt = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString("hex");
  var genHash = crypto
    .pbkdf2Sync(password, salt, 10000, 64, "sha512")
    .toString("hex");
  return {
    salt: salt,
    hash: genHash,
  };
}
```
In addition to the comments, I'll note that these functions require the NodeJS built-in crypto library. Some would argue a better crypto library, but unless your application requires a high degree of security, this library is plenty sufficient!

Next up, let's take a look at the passport.use() method.
```javascript
/**
 * This function is called when the `passport.authenticate()` method is called.
 *
 * If a user is found an validated, a callback is called (`cb(null, user)`) with the user
 * object.  The user object is then serialized with `passport.serializeUser()` and added to the
 * `req.session.passport` object.
 */
passport.use(
  new LocalStrategy(function (username, password, cb) {
    User.findOne({ username: username })
      .then((user) => {
        if (!user) {
          return cb(null, false);
        }
        // Function defined at bottom of app.js
        const isValid = validPassword(password, user.hash, user.salt);
        if (isValid) {
          return cb(null, user);
        } else {
          return cb(null, false);
        }
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        cb(err);
      });
  })
);
```
I know the above function is quite a lot to look at, so let's explore some of its key components. First, I'll mention that with all Passport JS authentication strategies (not just the local strategy we are using), you will need to supply it with a callback that will be executed when you call the passport.authenticate() method. For example, you might have a login route in your app:
```javascript
app.post(
  "/login",
  passport.authenticate("local", { failureRedirect: "/login" }),
  (err, req, res, next) => {
    if (err) next(err);
    console.log("You are logged in!");
  }
);
```
Your user will type in their username and password via a login form, which will create an HTTP POST request to the /login route. Let's say your post request contained the following data:
```javascript
{
  "email": "sample@email.com",
  "pw": "sample password"
}
```
This WILL NOT WORK. The reason? Because the passport.use() method expects your POST request to have the following fields:
```javascript
{
  "username": "sample@email.com",
  "password": "sample password"
}
```
It looks for username and password field. If you wanted the first json request body to work, you would need to supply the passport.use() function with field definitions:
```javascript
passport.use(
  {
    usernameField: "email",
    passwordField: "pw",
  },
  function (email, password, callback) {
    // Implement your callback function here
  }
);
```
By defining the usernameField and passwordField, you can specify a custom POST request body object.

That aside, let's return to the POST request at the /login route:
```javascript
app.post(
  "/login",
  passport.authenticate("local", { failureRedirect: "/login" }),
  (err, req, res, next) => {
    if (err) next(err);
    console.log("You are logged in!");
  }
);
```
When the user submits his/her login credentials, the passport.authenticate() method (used as middleware here) will execute the callback that you have defined and supply it with the username and password from the POST request body. The passport.authenticate() method takes two parameters--the name of the strategy, and options. The default strategy name here is local, but you could change this like so:
```javascript
// Supply a name string as the first argument to the passport.use() function
passport.use("custom-name", new Strategy());
// Use the same name as above
app.post(
  "/login",
  passport.authenticate("custom-name", { failureRedirect: "/login" }),
  (err, req, res, next) => {
    if (err) next(err);
    console.log("You are logged in!");
  }
);
```
The way I have used the passport.authenticate() strategy will first execute the callback function that we defined within new LocalStrategy(), and if the authentication is successful, it will call the next() function, and we will enter the route. If authentication was not successful (invalid username or password), the app will redirect to the /login route again.

Now that we understand how it is used, let's return to the callback function that we defined earlier and that passport.authenticate() is using.
```javascript
// Tells Passport to use this strategy for the passport.authenticate() method
passport.use(
  new LocalStrategy(
    // Here is the function that is supplied with the username and password field from the login POST request
    function (username, password, cb) {
      // Search the MongoDB database for the user with the supplied username
      User.findOne({ username: username })
        .then((user) => {
          /**
           * The callback function expects two values:
           *
           * 1. Err
           * 2. User
           *
           * If we don't find a user in the database, that doesn't mean there is an application error,
           * so we use `null` for the error value, and `false` for the user value
           */
          if (!user) {
            return cb(null, false);
          }
          /**
           * Since the function hasn't returned, we know that we have a valid `user` object.  We then
           * validate the `user` object `hash` and `salt` fields with the supplied password using our
           * utility function.  If they match, the `isValid` variable equals True.
           */
          const isValid = validPassword(password, user.hash, user.salt);
          if (isValid) {
            // Since we have a valid user, we want to return no err and the user object
            return cb(null, user);
          } else {
            // Since we have an invalid user, we want to return no err and no user
            return cb(null, false);
          }
        })
        .catch((err) => {
          // This is an application error, so we need to populate the callback `err` field with it
          cb(err);
        });
    }
  )
);
```
I have commented the above in great detail, so be sure to read through before moving on.

As you may notice, the callback function is database agnostic and validation agnostic. In other words, we don't need to use MongoDB nor do we need to validate our passwords in the same way. PassportJS leaves this up to us! This can be confusing, but is also extremely powerful and is why PassportJS has such widespread adoption.

Next, you'll see two related functions:
```javascript
passport.serializeUser(function (user, cb) {
  cb(null, user.id);
});
passport.deserializeUser(function (id, cb) {
  User.findById(id, function (err, user) {
    if (err) {
      return cb(err);
    }
    cb(null, user);
  });
});
```
Personally, I found these two functions to be the most confusing because there is not a lot of documentation around them. We will further explore what these functions are doing when we talk about how PassportJS and Express Session middleware interact, but in short, these two functions are responsible for "serializing" and "deserializing" users to and from the current session object.

Instead of storing the entire user object in the session, we only need to store the database ID for the user. When we need to get more information about the user in the current session, we can use the deserialize function to look the user up in the database using the ID that was stored in the session. Again, we will make more sense of this soon.

Finally, with the Passport implementation, you will see two more lines of code:
```javascript
app.use(passport.initialize());
app.use(passport.session());
```
If you remember from earlier in the post on how middleware works, by calling app.use(), we are telling Express to execute the functions within the parentheses in order on every request.

In other words, for every HTTP request our Express app makes, it will execute passport.initialize() and passport.session().

Something seem weird here??

If app.use() executes the function contained within, then the above syntax is like saying:
```javascript
passport.initialize()();
passport.session()();
```
The reason this works is because these two functions actually return another function! Kind of like this:
```javascript
Passport.prototype.initialize = function () {
  // Does something
  return function () {
    // This is what is called by `app.use()`
  };
};
```
This is not necessary to know to use Passport, but definitely clears up some confusion if you were wondering about that syntax.

Anyways...

These two middleware functions are necessary for integrating PassportJS with express-session middleware. That is why these two functions must come AFTER the app.use(session({})) middleware! Just like passport.serializeUser() and passport.deserializeUser(), these middlewares will make much more sense shortly.

Conceptual Overview of Session Based Authentication
Now that we understand HTTP Headers, Cookies, Middleware, Express Session middleware, and Passport JS middleware, it is finally time to learn how to use these to authenticate users into our application. I want to first use this section to review and explain the conceptual flow, and then dive into the implementation in the next section.

Here is a basic flow of our app:

Express app starts and listens on http://www.expressapp.com (just assume this is true for the sake of the example).
A user visits http://www.expressapp.com/login in the browser
The express-session middleware realizes that there is a user connecting to the Express server. It checks the Cookie HTTP header on the req object. Since this user is visiting for the first time, there is no value in the Cookie header. Because there is no Cookie value, the Express server returns the /login HTML and calls the Set-Cookie HTTP header. The Set-Cookie value is the cookie string generated by express-session middleware according to the options set by the developer (assume in this case the maxAge value is 10 days).
The user realizes that he doesn't want to login right now, but instead, wants to go for a walk. He closes his browser.
The user returns from his walk, opens the browser, and returns to http://www.expressapp.com/login again.
Again, the express-session middleware runs on the GET request, checks the Cookie HTTP header, but this time, finds a value! This is because the user had previously created a session earlier that day. Since the maxAge option was set to 10 days on the express-session middleware, closing the browser does not destroy the cookie.
The express-session middleware now takes the connect.sid value from the Cookie HTTP header, looks it up in the MongoStore (fancy way to say that it looks up the id in the database in the sessions collection), and finds it. Since the session exists, the express-session middleware does not do anything, and both the Cookie HTTP header value and the MongoStore database entry in the sessions collection stays the same.
Now, the user types in his username and password and presses the "Login" button.
By pressing the "Login" button, the user sends a POST request to the /login route, which uses the passport.authenticate() middleware.
On every request so far, the passport.initialize() and passport.session() middlewares have been running. On each request, these middlewares are checking the req.session object (created by the express-session middleware) for a property called passport.user (i.e. req.session.passport.user). Since the passport.authenticate() method had not been called yet, the req.session object did not have a passport property. Now that the passport.authenticate() method has been called via the POST request to /login, Passport will execute our user-defined authentication callback using the username and password our user typed in and submitted.
We will assume that the user was already registered in the database and typed in the correct credentials. The Passport callback validates the user successfully.
The passport.authenticate() method now returns the user object that was validated. In addition, it attaches the req.session.passport property to the req.session object, serializes the user via passport.serializeUser(), and attaches the serialized user (i.e. the ID of the user) to the req.session.passport.user property. Finally, it attaches the full user object to req.user.
The user turns off his computer and goes for another walk because our application is boring.
The user turns on his computer the next day and visits a protected route on our application.
The express-session middleware checks the Cookie HTTP header on req, finds the session from yesterday (still valid since our maxAge was set to 10 days), looks it up in MongoStore, finds it, and does nothing to the Cookie since the session is still valid. The middleware re-initializes the req.session object and sets to the value returned from MongoStore.
The passport.initialize() middleware checks the req.session.passport property and sees that there is still a user value there. The passport.session() middleware uses the user property found on req.session.passport.user to re-initialize the req.user object to equal the user attached to the session via the passport.deserializeUser() function.
The protected route looks to see if req.session.passport.user exists. Since the Passport middleware just re-initialized it, it does, and the protected route allows the user access.
The user leaves his computer for 2 months.
The user comes back and visits the same protected route (hint: the session has expired!)
The express-session middleware runs, realizes that the value of the Cookie HTTP header has an expired cookie value, and replaces the Cookie value with a new Session via the Set-Cookie HTTP header attached to the res object.
The passport.initialize() and passport.session() middlewares run, but this time, since express-session middleware had to create a new session, there is no longer a req.session.passport object!
Since the user did not log in and is trying to access a protected route, the route will check if req.session.passport.user exists. Since it doesn't, access is denied!
Once the user logs in again and triggers the passport.authenticate() middleware, the req.session.passport object will be re-established, and the user will again be able to visit protected routes.
Phewwww....

Got all that?
